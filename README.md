"am pro at leetcode trust" - Sun Tzu, The Art of Lying

I guess this is just going to be an Autobiography of my life in coding.

TL;DR version
---

- Honestly, all of my projects are silly.
- Most of the code I write is just a silly website for one very specific purpose, and then I never touch it again.
- I know HTML/CSS/JS, some C#, some Batch, a bit of Java, and a tiny bit of Python.
- I'm a sophomore
- I'm not taking requests for websites
    - (not that anyone is going to, given my portfolio, i just wanted to set the record straight.)

So, anyways, about me. I'm a sophomore in high school, and I'm taking classes for architecture. <br>You might wonder "what the hell is an architecture student doing on GitHub", which is a valid question. I've grown up around computers, as most of Gen Z has. However, I'm quite math-oriented, so I like to figure out how things work. <i>Inspect Element is honestly <u>my greatest friend.</u></i> I got into web development during lockdown through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttcOHNlNKPE">"Life of Boris" video</a> that popped up on my YouTube home feed. Cringy, I know. Atom by GitHub was my first app I learned to code in because of his tutorial. After that, I probably kept trying to make cool stuff. I learned CSS through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk&list=PLlj9BrHKq9WKaz8UV3BjEqicn-C3qHxy4&pp=iAQB">this Jake Wright tutorial playlist.</a> I also remember using Autocode (now defunct) to host my school's Robotics Club website, and the layout was... maybe a bit similar to the Jake Wright tutorial... anyways.

Before Autocode, I hadn't found a service to host any of my code (and as a student, i'm obviously not buying a domain from CloudFlare.) But after Autocode, sky was basically the limit. They had a 10,000 requests/month limit, which was perfect for what I was doing. And, as a student who played games on the side, I was obviously excited when I learned they had Discord bot support. I could code a bot myself- albeit in their own syntax, not Discord.JS- and make it say funny things to my friends!

Sometime after that they changed their limit to 1,000 requests/month... nothing too bad (foreshadowing to when they closed).

Since then, I've learned HTML/CSS/JS, some C#, some Batch, a bit of Java, and a tiny bit of Python.

So what does any of this mean to you? Nothing. Congrats, you wasted a solid minute reading this (or minute and a half if you read it aloud and in character). I guess it just makes my GitHub page look more "professional".

This isn't a LinkedIn post but I'm grateful of what I learned about web development because it laid a really strong foundation for tinkering, for thinking logically, and I appreciate every website just a little bit more. Nowadays I've made silly apps and small projects to solve a very small problem that nobody else has:

- For example, I made a white girl quiz (that's 100% accurate, I surveyed white girls so obviously the quiz's data cannot be flawed) that asks you a few questions and tells you how much of a white girl you are.

- Or, since my school district's technology department fell off and doesn't know how to style a page (they do just not well), or make a website, I'm working on a <br><s>C# Windows Forms app</s><br> C# Windows Presentation Foundation app now<br>that can replace the need for the website, and it was made with a ton of help from Google (the search engine, not Sundar himself), Claude, Stackoverflow, and the Mistral model on my computer.

- My final example would be the time that I made an EReader so I could actually focus during English since I cannot focus on a book for almost any period of time. It actually works kinda well, I guess.
