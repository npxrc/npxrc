Hi, I'm Neil:
- All of my projects are silly.
    - Most of my repositories are just silly websites for one very specific purpose, which I never touch again.
- I know HTML/CSS/JS, some C#, some Batch, a bit of Java, and a tiny bit of Python.
- I'm a junior
- I'm not taking requests for websites
    - not that anyone is going to, given my portfolio, i just wanted to set the record straight.

My humble beginnings learning to code started in Eclipse IDE, learning Java, all in sixth grade. No, that was not the best language to start with, but it got the ball rolling. I eventually learned to make websites, which were hosted via Autocode. I've now learned a lot of C# WinUI3, primarily from writing HourSync.

Most of my content is now hosted via Netlify and Cloudflare (specifically for HourSync)

- For example, I made a girly pop quiz (that's 100% accurate) that asks you a few questions and tells you how girly pop you are.

- Since my school district's technology department fell off and are bad at styling websites, I've made a WinUI3 app that can replace the need for the website, full of features for productivity and efficiency. The app automatically pushes updates and is significantly better than the official portal.
